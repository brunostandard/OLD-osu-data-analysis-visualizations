## Overview
This folder contains some files in regards to webscraping. 

## Description

- `scraper.py` is the main script used to scrape through the site osu.ppy.sh. 
- `scraping_test.py` is the auxillary script for scraper.py. This is where the main scraping is done.
- `test_csv_gen.py` is a script demonstrating how to write on csv files. It's there for educational purposes. 
- `new_player_data.csv` is the result of all of this.

## Notes
What's amazing here is the result of this web-scraping. I've gathered 10,000 rows of data within minutes. It took close to an hour getting 5,000 rows of data, and that is not including filtering and formatting. 

After applying some web-scraping techniques, I won't be posting the older pythong code.

Description
----------------------------------------------------------------
This is a personal project.

This is an analysis of rank data from the site osu.ppy.sh. The are several parts to this analysis. I took the following steps:
1. Copy data from osu.ppy.sh (by hand)
2. Copy data from osu.pppy.sh (by hand) with the way back machine for older ranked data. 
3. Format the raw data with python
	- Some visualizations is done here too.
4. Use python to import the "formatted" data onto a local mysql database. 
	- This part is for having a database to store data. 
	- This is also a method for learning mysql and relational databases. 
	- This will be expanded upon more.
